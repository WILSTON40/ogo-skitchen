            <p>Cybersecurity is the protection of internet-connected systems such as hardware, software and data from cyber threats. The practice is used by individuals and enterprises to protect against unauthorized access to data centers and other computerized systems.</p>

            <td>
                <p>Cybersecurity programs should also address end-user education. Employees may accidentally bring threats and vulnerabilities into the workplace on their laptops or mobile devices. Likewise, they may act insecurely -- for example, clicking links or downloading attachments from phishing emails. Regular security awareness training will help employees do their part in keeping their company safe from cyber threats.</p>
            </td>
            <td>
                <p>Organizations can do their best to maintain security, but if the partners, suppliers and third-party vendors that access their networks don't act securely, all that effort is for naught. Software- and hardware-based supply chain attacks are becoming increasingly difficult security challenges to contend with. Organizations must address third-party risk in the supply chain and reduce software supply issues, for example by using software bills of materials.</p>
